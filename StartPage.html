    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Owned by Alphabet.inc</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate created in a corporate restructuring on October 2, 2015.It is the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.The two founders of Google assumed executive roles in the new company, with Larry Page serving as CEO and Sergey Brin as President.The company is based in Mountain View, California.
    <br>
    Alphabet's portfolio encompasses several industries, including technology, life sciences, investment capital, and research. Some of its subsidiaries include Google, Calico, GV, CapitalG, Verily, Waymo, X, and Google Fiber. Some of the subsidiaries of Alphabet have altered their names since leaving Googleâ€”Google Ventures becoming GV, Google Life Sciences becoming Verily and Google X becoming just X. Following the restructuring Page became CEO of Alphabet while Sundar Pichai took his position as CEO of Google.Shares of Google's stock have been converted into Alphabet stock, which trade under Google's former ticker symbols of "GOOG" and "GOOGL".
    <br>
    The establishment of Alphabet was prompted by a desire to make the core Google Internet services business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.</p>
